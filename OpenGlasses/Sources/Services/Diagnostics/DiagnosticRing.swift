/// A bounded, in-memory tail of the structured events the app has already logged.
///
/// This is deliberately not a second logging system. It subscribes to `PrivacyLog` at the point
/// where an event has already been encoded, and keeps the *same line* the OS log received — so
/// everything the classification table forbids is absent here for exactly the reason it is absent
/// there: no method on the facade accepts it. That is what makes an opt-out-free, on-by-default
/// tap defensible; a ring of content would need consent to *collect*, and this one needs consent
/// only to *leave the device*.
///
/// The shared ring checkpoints its bounded tail locally, together with what earlier runs left
/// (`previousEntries`), so a consented export can reach back across relaunches for up to
/// `defaultMaxAge`. An earlier run is not evidence that it ended in a crash. Writes are
/// asynchronous and coalesced, so an abrupt exit may lose the latest queued events.
///
/// ## What is kept
///
/// A tester's support report held exactly the newest 500 lines of a long run: the launch and the
/// first minutes had been evicted with nothing to say so, and only the immediately previous run
/// survived a relaunch. So, per run:
/// - the first `launchLimit` events are the **launch window** and are never evicted;
/// - after them, events are kept for `maxAge` and up to `capacity` in all, oldest dropped first,
///   and the first event kept after a drop carries the count (`Entry.gapBefore`) so the export
///   can say "N earlier events not kept" where the hole is;
/// - earlier runs are appended to the persisted history rather than overwritten, bounded by the
///   same age and count, and every entry carries its run's id so the export can mark where one
///   run ends and the next begins.
