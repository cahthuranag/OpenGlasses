/// on such a model fails the same way, so the turn sends the catalog's own default instead — for
/// that turn only: the saved setting is the wearer's and is left as it is, and every turn that
/// substitutes asks for a fresh catalog (throttled), so the saved model returns within minutes of
/// the catalog listing it again.
