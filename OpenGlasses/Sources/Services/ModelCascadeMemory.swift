/// arrive, a request that hangs for the whole timeout — every turn pays that wait again before
/// the hop, and a wearer who has already heard "switching to ChatGPT" waits forty seconds for
/// "OK" to be acknowledged (tester report, 2026-10-20: four such turns in twenty minutes).

/// This type remembers one thing: the lead the chain hopped away from, and the model that then
/// answered. For a bounded hold the chain starts on that model instead, with the lead moved to
/// second place so a failure there still finds it. The hold ends on its own, or at once when the
/// lead answers a turn again (the wearer picked it back, or the hold expired and it recovered).
