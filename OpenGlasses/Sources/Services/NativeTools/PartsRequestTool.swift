    Ask base for a part on the active Field Assist job, or record base's reply. Pass 'part' (the \
    number exactly as the manual or the label prints it) with 'quantity', optionally 'task_id' to \
    tie it to a task, 'urgency' (routine, today, emergency), 'on_van' when the technician \
    already has one, and 'for_van_stock' when the part is to restock the van rather than to be \
    fitted on this job. The number is checked against the vault's parts list and its manuals and the \
    page it was found on is recorded; a number that is not there is recorded unverified and you \
    must tell the technician so. A request does not need a task — a stock check can go out before \
    the repair is decided. To record what base replied, pass 'answer' with the text they sent (and \
    'part' or 'request_id' to say which request it answers): that is filed against the request and \
    read to the technician, and it never changes a task or a recommendation by itself. To email \
    the office a parts order, pass action 'send' (optionally 'to' with an address or contact, \
    'request_id' for one request only, and 'note'); the composer opens on the technician's phone \
    and they tap Send; the request is marked sent once it goes. This is separate from the job \
    report — do not use deliver_report or send_message to order a part. Requires an active session.
