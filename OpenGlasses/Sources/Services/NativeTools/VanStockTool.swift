    The technician's own van or truck stock, kept on the phone. Use it whenever they ask what is \
    on the van or truck, or say they loaded, used, returned or counted parts. Works without a job \
    open and without signal. Pass 'action': 'check' (how many of one part; pass 'part' and/or \
    'description'), 'low' (what has run out or is at its minimum), 'load' (parts put on the van), \
    'use' (parts fitted from the van; tagged to the open job), 'remove' (parts taken off for \
    another reason; pass 'reason'), 'count' (a stocktake: sets the figure), 'undo' (takes back \
    the last spoken entry), 'unrecorded' (parts on this job's finished tasks with no stock entry), \
    'not_from_van' (a part on this job that was ordered in or was the customer's; pass 'part'), \
    'top_up' (what it takes to bring the van back to its standard load), 'set_standard' (how many \
    of a part this truck should carry; pass 'quantity', 0 for none), or 'send_to_base' (stages the \
    end-of-shift stock for the technician to send; it sends nothing itself). To record a top-up, \
    call 'load' with 'to_standard' true, and 'items' naming any parts that could not be filled. \
    For one part pass 'part' (the number exactly as printed), \
    'description', 'quantity' and optionally 'unit'; for several parts in one sentence pass \
    'items', each with the same fields. A scanned barcode goes in 'code'. Read the result back to \
    the technician as given: it says how each figure is known, and it spells out a part number it \
    has not met so a misheard one can be undone. Never state a quantity this tool did not return. \
    When more than one line fits, ask which one. When the result offers a replacement, ask the \
    technician before requesting one.
